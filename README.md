# Base Makefile
> Ready to use makefile for your project
## How to Use 
- Copy the `makefile_base/example_build_config.mk` file to your project directory and name it `build_config.mk`
- Under your project directory, create a file called `Makefile` which imports your `build_config.mk` and `makefile_base/Makefile`
- To adjust to a new tested project, please only modify the first section of `build_config.mk`
